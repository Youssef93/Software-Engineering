A1: Build Logical Gates
Preconditions:  
1.	User installed the program.
2.      User has a circuit he wants to build or simulate.
Basic flow:                       
1.	User opens the program.
2.	User chooses the gates he wants to build. 
3.	User connects them.
4.      User deletes the wrongly connected gates.
5.	User chooses the inputs ( Zeros or Ones ).
6.	User connects the outputs.
Alternative Flow 1:
A1.1	User simulates the circuit.
Alternative Flow 2:
A2.1    User wants to save the simulated circuit.
A2.2	User chooses file.
A2.3    User chooses save.
A2.4    A new window opens so as the user chooses where to save the simulated circuit.
A2.5	He chooses the place to save the simulated circuit and press save.
Alternative Flow  3:
A3.1	User load a previously saved circuit.
A3.2    User simulates it.
Post conditions: User gets the simulation of the circuit.
Abnormal paths:
1.	User forgets to choose the inputs of the circuit or doesnt connect the input to the gate. An Error will appear to the user.
2.	User forgets to connect the outputs of the circuit. An Error will appear to the user.
3.      User connects the output of a gate to the input of the same gate in his circuit. 
4.	User chooses to load a saved circuit while he hasn’t saved a circuit before. Nothing will happen.
5.      User chooses to run the simulation with no gates in the field. Nothing will happen.
